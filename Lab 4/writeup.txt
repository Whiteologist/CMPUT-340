The results are close enough to be useful in the optimization
since the differences of the two Jacobian matrices (see e1.m)
are close enough when a very small alpha value (e.g. 1.0e+4) is used 
Thus we could use the Jacobian matrix from finite-difference approximation

Finite-difference approximation is prefered over analytic derivative
in the case when analytic derivative is hard to compute.
Also, in some cases, simply computing the analytic derivative has an error
since the values used in computing are rounded

The comparison between Newton and Broyden:
From experiment, the robot performance in Newton's Method tends to be
moving more accurate towards desired location compared to Broyden's Method.
Also, Newton Mode takes less clicks than Broyden Mode if the distance
is far from the previous position (2 vs 5)
